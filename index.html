    <h1>Sonic</h1>
    <p> Constantly on the move, Sonic pursues a life of adventures. He has spent most of his life traveling around the world and beyond, usually accompanied by his best friend, Tails. In his journeys, he has defended his world and others from various threats, especially his arch-nemesis, Doctor Eggman. Described as being "like the wind", Sonic is easygoing and honest, but also impatient and short-tempered. He possesses a strong sense of independence and justice, despises oppression, and is loyal to his friends. His many adventures have earned him many titles, allies, and foes, and made him a celebrated hero. However, he remains indifferent to his fame, preferring to live on his own terms.</p>
