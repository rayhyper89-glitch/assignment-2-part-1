    <h2> Sonic's base design was based off an originally discarded sketch of a character named "Mr. Hedgehog",[note 1][24] by Ohshima. The team settled on Sonic's final name to represent speed and took the name Sonic Team.[25][26] Sonic was designed to be easy for children to draw.[23] His pigment of blue was adjusted several times during development to match Sega's logo and for higher contrast against backgrounds.[19][27][28] Ohshima combined Felix the Cat's head with Mickey Mouse's body for Sonic's design, with inspiration from the cover for Michael Jackson's album Bad and Santa Claus's costume for Sonic's shoes.[29][19] Sonic was created without the ability to swim because of Naka's mistaken assumption that hedgehogs could not do so.[30]</h2>
